				The protagonists of the One Piece series are all the members of the Straw Hat Pirates (麦わらの一味, Mugiwara no Ichimi), a crew of ten pirates captained by Monkey D. Luffy. The crew's number increases throughout the series, as Luffy recruits new members. Once Usopp joins the Straw Hat Pirates, they gain their own ship, the Going Merry, which is later destroyed and replaced by a larger and more powerful vessel, the Thousand Sunny created by their shipwright Franky. Two years later, the Straw Hats gain a new fleet, called the Straw Hat Grand Fleet, consisting of 5,640 pirates from seven different crews; Luffy objects to the idea of being a fleet commander, and organizes his new army in a way that they may act independently, but when one crew is in trouble, the others must do what they can to help them. By the end of the Wano Country Arc, the Straw Hat Pirates are recognized as an Emperor-led crew with Luffy also being recognized as the leader of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet[ch. 903] and the other nine members as its Senior Officers[ch. 1058] after the defeat of both Kaido and Big Mom.
