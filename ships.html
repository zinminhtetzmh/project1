			<span>Going Merry</span><br>
			The Very First Ship Of The Crew
		</h2>
		<p>
			The Going Merry[4] was the first full-sized ship owned by the Straw Hat Pirates, a caravel that served as their main transportation through the East Blue, and the Grand Line up until Water 7. It was often affectionally referred to as simply Merry (メリー, Merī?) by the crew.<br><br>
			Originally designed by Kaya's servant Merry, it was gifted to the Straw Hats for defending Syrup Village against the Black Cat Pirates. Over time, it came to be loved by the crew as a home and as a friend, so much so that she eventually developed a life of her own and became a genuine crew member. Unfortunately, the Going Merry took an inordinate amount of damage during her "lifetime", being blown up, impaled, sliced up multiple times, and partially eaten by Wapol. Eventually, the Merry could no longer continue and after helping the Straw Hats escape Enies Lobby, it received a Viking funeral.[5]<br><br>
			After its destruction, the Merry was succeeded by the Thousand Sunny, a ship specially built by Franky (and the Galley-La Company) to maintain the "soul" of its predecessor.[6]

			Current Ship Of The Crew
		</h2>
		<p>
			The Thousand Sunny is the second ship of the Straw Hat Pirates, built after the Going Merry was destroyed. It is often referred to as Sunny (サニー, Sanī?) by the crew.<br><br>
			It is a brigantine-type ship designed and built by Franky with help from Yokozuna, Iceburg, and the remaining Galley-La foremen who were among the best shipwrights in the world.[1]<br><br>
			Built from Adam Wood, it is a magnificent ship of the finest craftsmanship at least double the size of the Going Merry. Its features include practically all of the various requests the Straw Hats had before arriving in Water 7.
