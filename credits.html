		<h2>Eiichiro Oda</h2>
		<p>
			Eiichiro Oda (Japanese: 尾田 栄一郎, Hepburn: Oda Eiichirō, born January 1, 1975) is a Japanese manga artist and the creator of the series One Piece. With more than 516.6 million tankōbon copies in circulation worldwide, One Piece is both the best-selling manga in history and the best-selling comic series printed in volume, in turn making Oda one of the best-selling fiction authors.[2] The series' popularity resulted in Oda being named one of the manga artists that changed the history of manga.[3] Eiichiro Oda has been married to Chiaki Inaba (稲葉ちあき, Inaba Chiaki), a former model and actress, since November 7, 2004. Oda and Inaba have had two daughters, the eldest was born in mid-2006 and the youngest in 2009.
