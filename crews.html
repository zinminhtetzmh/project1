					<strong>Monkey D. Luffy</strong> (モンキー・D・ルフィ, Monkī Dī Rufi) is the captain of the Straw Hat Pirate and the main protagonist of the One Piece series. At age seven, he admires and tries to join the pirates of the "Red Haired" Shanks. Ridiculed and rejected, he inadvertently eats their treasure, the Paramecia-type Gum-Gum Fruit (ゴムゴムの実, Gomu Gomu no Mi), which gives him rubbery attributes. His reckless efforts ultimately lead him into grave peril causing Shanks to lose an arm while rescuing him. After this, Luffy gives up on joining Shanks, resolving instead to start a crew of his own and become King of the Pirates.[ch. 1] Displeased by Shanks spoiling his grandson, Garp takes Luffy to be raised by Curly Dadan and her mountain bandits, who he strong-arms into taking him in. During Luffy's time there, he becomes a sworn brother with Ace, Garp's other ward, and Sabo, a local runaway noble.[ch. 582–589] <br><br>
					Ten years later and still wearing Shanks' treasured straw hat, Luffy forms and commands his own pirate crew called The Straw Hat Pirates and sets sail for the Grand Line, quickly gaining infamy as "Straw Hat" Luffy (麦わらのルフィ, Mugiwara no Rufi).[ch. 2, 7, 96, 98] Eventually, after his strength proves insufficient to save Ace from execution, he spends two years on a secluded island, learning the use of the three colors of Haki as well as his rubber ability's fourth Gear from Silvers Rayleigh, before heading to the New World.[ch. 590–602] Due to his infamy, he is one of the pirates who are known as "The Worst Generation". After the defeat of Kaido and Big Mom, he is subsequently named one of the newest members of the Four Emperors. Luffy is also capable of using the advanced application for all types of Haki. During his fight with Kaido, his devil fruit power awakened, revealing its true nature as the Mythical Zoan-type, Human-Human Fruit, Model: Nika.

					<strong>Roronoa Zoro</strong> (ロロノア・ゾロ) is a swordsman who uses up to three swords simultaneously, holding one in each hand and a third in his mouth.[ch. 3, 5, 28] To fulfill a promise to Kuina, his deceased childhood friend and rival, he aims to defeat "Hawk-Eye" Mihawk and become the world's greatest swordsman.[ch. 5, 50] Traveling the seas in search of Mihawk and making a living as a bounty hunter, he becomes infamously known as "Pirate Hunter" Zoro (海賊狩りのゾロ, Kaizoku-Gari no Zoro). <br><br>
					Eventually, he comes into conflict with Helmeppo, the spoiled son of a navy officer. To prevent the harm of innocent civilians, Zoro allows himself to be incarcerated temporarily, while Helmeppo plots to have him killed. Zoro is saved from execution by Luffy in exchange for becoming his first crewman. At that point, Zoro makes it clear that he would turn on his captain if he ever stepped between him and his dream.[ch. 2–6] However, Zoro grows fond of his crew and after several defeats in their defense, his priorities change and he convinces Mihawk to take him on as a student.[ch. 51f., 485, 597] Zoro is capable of utilizing all three types of Haki and is capable of using the advanced application for both Haoshoku and Busoshoku Haki. He is known for his awful sense of direction and constantly gets lost when traveling.

					Born as a prince of Germa Kingdom, <strong>Vinsmoke Sanji</strong> (ヴィンスモーク・サンジ, Vinsumōku Sanji) is routinely ridiculed by his genetically enhanced siblings and is locked away by his father Judge for being a disgrace. With help from his sister Reiju, he escapes and flees Germa, a floating kingdom composed of several ships, after it enters the East Blue and his father permits it. <br><br>
					While serving as an apprentice cook on a passenger ship, nine-year-old Sanji stands up to a boarding party of pirates led by the infamous "Red Foot" Zeff. During the encounter, Sanji is swept into the sea by a massive wave. Zeff jumps in after him because of their common dream of finding the All Blue (オールブルー, Ōru Burū), a legendary area where the East, West, North, and South Blue seas meet, containing every kind of fish in the world. While castaways together, the pirate saves Sanji's life yet again by giving him all of their food. After their eventual rescue, Sanji stays with Zeff for several years and helps him build a floating restaurant, the Baratie (バラティエ). Zeff in turn makes him a first-rate cook and teaches him his kick-based fighting style.[ch. 56–59] Mirroring Zeff, Sanji will never refuse a starving person a meal, and he uses only his legs when fighting to protect the hands he needs for cooking.[ch. 48, 370] He has a weakness for women and makes it a principle never to harm one, even if it means his death.[ch. 403] <br><br>
					Eventually, he becomes infamous as "Black Leg" Sanji (黒脚のサンジ, Kuro Ashi no Sanji).[ch. 435] While training for a period of two years in Emporio Ivankov's Kamabakka Queendom (カマバッカ王国, Kamabakka Ōkoku), he develops the Sky Walk (空中歩行スカイ・ウォーク, Sukai Wōku), a variant of the Six Powers (六式, Rokushiki) technique Moonwalk (月歩, Geppo), which allows him to essentially run through air.[ch. 635] Sanji receives his own Raid Suit from his family that grants him the ability to turn invisible[ch. 903], though he later destroys it out of fear of losing his humanity.[ch. 1031] <br><br>
					Sanji's standard appearance is wearing a well-fitting black suit with a skinny black tie. His hair always covers one of his eyes and he is usually smoking a cigarette.

					During his early childhood, <strong>Usopp</strong> (ウソップ, Usoppu) was abandoned by his father, Yasopp, who left to join the Red-Haired Pirates. As his mother, Bachina, falls ill, Usopp starts telling tall tales, expressing his hope that his father will return and take them out to sea. He regularly goes to the mansion at the top of the hill where he lives, to visit Kaya. Even after his mother dies, Usopp does not blame his father for leaving. Despite his cowardly disposition, he strives to become a great pirate.[ch. 25, 41] <br><br>
					Usopp is recognizable for his long nose, a reference to the fact that he tends to lie a lot. He is a gifted inventor, painter, and sculptor.[ch. 42, 106, 190] In combat, he relies primarily on slingshots to fire various kinds of ammunition with great precision in coordination with a set of lies and other weapons giving him a unique fighting style named "The Usopp Arsenal".[ch. 332] To help the Straw Hats rescue Nico Robin, he achieves notoriety under his alter-ego "Sogeking, the King of Snipers" (狙撃の王様そげキング, Sogeki no Ō-sama Sogekingu), a hero sniper wearing a golden mask and cape. Eventually, after helping the Straw Hats liberate Dressrosa from Donquixote Doflamingo's rule, he becomes infamous as "God" Usopp (ゴッド ウソップ, Goddo Usoppu).[ch. 435]

					Adopted and raised by navy seaman turned tangerine farmer Belle-Mère, <strong>Nami</strong> (ナミ) witnessed her mother being murdered by the infamous Arlong, whose pirate gang occupies their island and extracts tribute from the population. Striking a deal with him, Nami, still a child, but already an accomplished cartographer who dreams of drawing a complete map of the world, joins the pirates, hoping to buy freedom for her village eventually. Growing up as a pirate-hating pirate drawing maps for Arlong and stealing treasure from other pirates, Nami becomes an excellent burglar, pickpocket, and navigator with an exceptional ability to forecast weather.[ch. 77, 95, 130] After Arlong betrays her, and he and his gang are defeated by the Straw Hat Pirates, Nami joins them in pursuit of her dream and acquires infamy herself as "Cat Burglar" Nami (泥棒猫のナミ, Dorobō Neko no Nami).[ch. 94f., 435]

					<strong>Tony Tony Chopper</strong> (トニートニー・チョッパー, Tonī Tonī Choppā) is an anthropomorphic reindeer and doctor. The power of the Zoan-type Human-Human Fruit (ヒトヒトの実, Hito Hito no Mi) provides him with the ability to transform into a full-sized reindeer or a reindeer-human hybrid.[ch. 140] A self-developed drug he calls Rumble Ball (ランブル・ボール, Ranburu Bōru) enables him to perform even more transformations for three minutes.[ch. 149] With help from Caesar Clown, Chopper can last in his transformations for about 30 minutes.[ch. 1014] <br><br>
					Rejected by his herd because of his blue nose and eating the Devil Fruit, Chopper is rescued by Drum Island's quack doctor Doctor Hiriluk. While developing a potion to create cherry blossoms when in contact with snow, Chopper is heartbroken when Hiriluk falls ill with a deadly disease. After Hiriluk's death, Doctor Kureha takes him in as his mentor. After the Straw Hats arrive at Drum Island and take Chopper with them, Kureha uses Hiriluk's potion to turn the snowy sky into cherry blossoms, fulfilling Hiriluk's life mission. When complimented, Chopper acts flustered and sometimes yells at the person who complimented him to stop trying to make him happy.[ch. 140] A running gag within the series is when other characters mistake him as a Tanuki, and he angrily corrects them, pointing out that he is a Tonakai (Japanese for "Reindeer").

					Being raised in Ohara (オハラ), home of the world's oldest and largest library, <strong>Nico Robin</strong> (ニコ・ロビン, Niko Robin) becomes an archaeologist at the age of eight.[ch. 218,391f.] At some point she gains the power of the Paramecia-type Flower-Flower Fruit (ハナハナの実, Hana Hana no Mi), which allows her to have temporary copies of parts of her body, including her eyes and ears, which spring up on surfaces near her.[ch. 170] Behind her teachers' backs, she acquires from them the outlawed knowledge of how to translate the ancient stones called Poneglyphs (歴史の本文ポーネグリフ, Pōnegurifu, alt. Poneglyphs), which are scattered around the world. She comes to share their goal of finding the elusive Real Ponegliff (真の歴史の本文リオ・ポーネグリフ, Rio Pōnegurifu), which is said to tell the world's lost history referred to as the 100-Year Void (空白の100年, Kūhaku no Hyaku-nen, Void Century).[ch. 218] However, the World Government finds out about these efforts and sends a battlefleet to stop them. Only Robin escapes the devastating attack that claims the lives of the island's entire population, including that of her mother.[ch. 218, 395] <br><br>
					Called "Devil Child" (悪魔の子, Akuma no Ko), traumatized, and with a bounty on her head, Robin lives a life on the run, unable to trust anyone.[ch. 218] To survive, she cooperates with various pirates and other outlaws. She eventually joins Sir Crocodile's Baroque Works group, using the codename "Ms. All-Sunday" (ミス・オールサンデー, Misu Ōrusandē)[ch. 398] and becomes their vice-president.[ch. 218] After Baroque Works falls apart, with nowhere else to go, she tags along with the Straw Hat Pirates[ch. 218] and grows so fond of them that she gives herself up to the Government to save them. After they discover her real reason for leaving, the Straw Hat Pirates declare open war against the Government to get her back. She realizes that she has finally found people who will never betray her and joins the crew.[ch. 398] Two years later, Robin further hones her Devil Fruit powers to the point she can create a full-bodied duplicate of herself.

					The son of pirate parents who abandoned him at age nine, <em>Cutty Flam</em> (カティ・フラム, Kati Furamu) changed his name to <strong>Franky</strong> (フランキー, Furankī) and is taken in as an apprentice by shipwright Tom, who built Pirate King Gol D Roger's ship, the Oro Jackson, and also secretly holds the plans for a devastating ancient weapon.[ch. 344, 354, 427] Franky's recklessness eventually provides an opportunity for World Government agents seeking these plans.[ch. 356] Attempting to rescue his master, Franky suffers severe injuries and only survives by rebuilding parts of his body using pieces of scrap metal, turning himself into a cola-powered cyborg with strength.[ch. 336, 339, 352, 357f.] After gaining notoriety as "Cyborg" Franky (サイボーグ フランキー, Saibōgu Furankī), and to fulfill his dream of sailing a ship he built around the world, he constructs the Thousand Sunny, a brigantine-rigged sloop-of-war, for the Straw Hat Pirates and joins the crew.[ch. 435-437]

					Already a pirate before the time of Roger, "Humming" <strong>Brook</strong> (ブルック, Burukku) first enters the Grand Line as a member of the music-themed Rumbar Pirates. Leaving his pet, the infant whale Laboon (ラブーン, Rabūn), at Reverse Mountain, he promises to return after sailing around the world.[ch. 487] After losing his captain "Calico" Yorki (キャラコのヨーキ, Kyarako no Yōki), Brook took over the crew as the new captain. Some time later, he is annihilated, but the power of the Paramecia-type Revive-Revive Fruit (ヨミヨミの実, Yomi Yomi no Mi) allows him to resurrect as a skeleton.[ch. 443] Fifty years later, Brook's goal is still to fulfill his late crew's promise, and to that end he joins the Straw Hat Pirates.[ch. 459] <br><br>
					He is an excellent musician, who says that he can play any instrument, although he is usually seen playing the violin.[ch. 486] Brook can even influence people with his music to the point of making them fall asleep.[ch. 454] While separated from the other Straw Hats, and incognito as "Soul King" Brook, he gains world fame, filling concert halls with fans.[ch. 600] He is also a skilled fencer who uses a shikomizue (a Japanese cane sword) in battle.[ch. 454] His reduced weight allows him to jump extraordinarily high and to run across water.[ch. 443, 493] Eventually, Brook learns how to use his Devil Fruit ability to leave his skeleton body and explore his surroundings as a disembodied soul.[ch. 629] <br><br>
					The idea of a skeleton musician was first conceived by Oda in 2000, about the time of Laboon's introduction and more than half a decade before the first appearance of Brook.[21]

					<strong>Jimbei</strong> (ジンベエ, Jinbē) is a yakuza-esque whale shark-type fish-man.[ch. 528] A master of Fish-Man Karate (魚人空手, Gyojin Karate), he is capable of manipulating water as if it were a tangible cloth.[ch. 546] Jimbei can communicate with fish, an ability more usually associated with merfolk, and enlist the help of whale sharks.[ch. 547–549] After growing up in a rough part of Fish-Man Island, Jimbei first joins the island's royal army and later the Sun Pirates; he becomes captain following the death of Fisher Tiger.[ch. 624] In exchange for the World Government granting him Warlord-status and amnesty to the Sun Pirates, Jimbei eventually disbands the crew.[ch. 69] He resigns the position to side against the Government during its war with the Whitebeard Pirates, the protectors of Fish-Man Island.[ch. 557] Two years later, he enlists the help of the Straw Hat Pirates to prevent the New Fish-Man Pirates' coup d'état against Fish-Man Island's royal family. Jimbei then turns down an invitation from Luffy to join his crew, having already aligned with the Big Mom Pirates after the death of Whitebeard.[ch. 649] After cutting ties with Big Mom, he joins the Straw Hat Pirates as the crew's helmsman.[ch. 863][ch. 976]
